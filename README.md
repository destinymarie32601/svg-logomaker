# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This project is a node command-line application that allows users to create professional SVG logos. The project is started by opening a new terminal and typing in ' node index.js '. This project uses object oriented programming to create .svg files through the command line. This project uses Jest for testing as well as the Inquirer package. This project furthered my knowledge with testing using Jest, as well as working with constructors. I have advanced my skills in creating command-line applications.
